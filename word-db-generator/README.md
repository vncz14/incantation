problems

-   `alt-of` tag stuff
    -   american vs british english spellings
        -   e.g. `labor` is not a word
        -   we somehow need to categorize words with several spellings
-   words that are not tagged as `form-of` but are still basically forms of other words
    -   e.g. `hybridization` -> `hybridation`
-   can't detect prefixes and suffixes sometimes
    -   e.g. `homoacetogenic`
-   vulgar words not always tagged
    -   e.g. `d**do`
    -   use external list
-   detect compounds using `etymology_templates` field, for rating later
    -   e.g. `hyperthreading`
    -   but compounds aren't always tagged as such
        -   e.g. `nephewlike`
-   definition of plurals
